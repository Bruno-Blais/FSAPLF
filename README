# Command Line Arguments / modes
#-----------------------------------

Notes : all command line arguments should be given as lowercase letters

---
BATCH:
    -batch nFlush

Flushes the memory after nFlush files are processed. This prevents memory overload. 
By default -batch is false, but eventually a default value will be put in.
---

---
EXT:
    -ext extension

Extension of the file your want to post-process (i.e .dump)
---

---
OUT:
    -out path

Path of the output files that will be made by FSAPLF

---
PLANE
    -plane type axis nPlanes size beggining end

Types : Square, circle rectangle
Axis : 0-x , 1-y, 2-z
size : Square : L, circle R, retancle L and W

Carry out a porosity analysys using the interesection between the particles and a number of plane decided by the user.
This gives a much finer analysis than the void fraction projection onto the mesh

PCA
    -pca

# Description of the software
#-----------------------------------


#-----------------------------------
# Examples
#-----------------------------------

# Shear layer case
# Launch averaging and plane analysis along z axis with 200 square planes of dimension 0.025
fsaplf -ext .dump -average -out ./out -path ./post -plane 1 2 200 0.025 0.001 0.025

# Mixing case
# Launch averaging and plane analysis along z axis with 200 circular planes of dimension 0.025
fsaplf -ext .dump -average 0.999 -out ./outFsaplf/ -path ./post -plane 2 2 200 0.1825 0.0001 0.365  -batch 10

#Design Decisions & Issues
#-------------------------

- Right now the entire data structure is based around C-type arrays. Everything should be migrated to C++ type vectors, this would be much better
- The structure for the plane and the steps is very approximate (using a weird copy constructor that is kept within options and relaunched every iteration)
     however it works well so I will keep it that way for a moment (aka forever)
